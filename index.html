	<section class="content">
		<p>I am a Senior Consultant @Deloitte Consulting. Typically, I specialize in analytics but as a consultant you have to be able to do a little of everything. In my role at Deloitte I have worked on strategic communications projects, human capital dashboarding, systems design, requirements gathering, web application development, and UX design. There really isn't anything that is ever truly out of scope when you are a jack of all trades.</p>

		<p>In a former life I provided financial analytics consulting to Audi where I also previously worked as an assistant controller and the first corporate fleet consultant. Before making my way to the DC metro I worked as a stock broker, a business analyst, and spied on foreign entities.</p>
